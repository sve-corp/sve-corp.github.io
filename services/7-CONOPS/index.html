<h2 id="concept-description"><strong>Concept Description</strong></h2>

<p>The device is worn around the neck. Radial orientation does not matter, but users will often find that placing the sensors and electronics directly on the back of the neck is the most secure location. The sensor faces the skin and requires close contact for better signal accuracy. Shown in the sketch below we see the buttons and LED indicators, which are on the opposite side of the sensor [not shown]. The sensor is secured via an integrated belt that is adjustable and clips together. The clip that binds the two straps has a breakaway force of 5 lbs at the clip. This is an important safety feature to prevent over tightening on the neck. Or in the case of removal can quickly with little effort be removed. The breakaway clip does not damage the mechanism when pulled. This is similar to certain bicycle helmets but with a much lower force requirement. The LED are used for power, error and button pushing indications. There are three buttons on the sensors that will be used for power and menu navigation. There will be extra functionality with button presses differentiating short and long button presses.  The device handles the data collection internally on its own hardware and communicates via bluetooth the information to the VR headset. Its rechargeable battery operated with a single charging port. The battery is not removable.</p>

<h3 id="components"><strong>Components:</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Electronic device:</strong> Main device that has a singular PCB board with various peripherals attached. The main PCB has the CPU and required electronics to run and communicate with all secondary subcomponents.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Subcomponents:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>oximetry sensor:</strong> Sensor used to collect data.</li>
          <li><strong>Battery</strong>: Rechargeable battery used for power.</li>
          <li><strong>RF Transmitter/Receiver:</strong> Required peripheral for bluetooth communication.</li>
          <li><strong>Power input:</strong> Barrel jack input port.</li>
          <li><strong>LEDs:</strong> Low power LEDs for indicators</li>
          <li><strong>Buttons:</strong> buttons used for power/select modes.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Strapping Mechanism:</strong> Device used to secure the electronics and sensor to the user.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Subcomponents:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Strap:</strong> Strap can be made from a variety of interchangeable silicon materials. It is important for it to be slightly elastic, but not unbreakable for safety considerations..</li>
              <li><strong>Breakaway Buckle:</strong> The buckle is a costume design that has specifications listed in the product design category. It has strick testing standards to meet safety requirements.</li>
              <li><strong>Excess Strap Holders:</strong> Simple bands used to hold excess strap against itself.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Charging Cable:</strong> Cable used to charge electronic devices.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Subcomponents:</strong> Barrel jacket style charge that uses AC to DC converter for low amp, low voltage devices. COTS compatible.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Major Phases:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Phase 0: Charging/Recharging</strong>		When the electronic device is plugged into a DC power supply, the battery will begin to charge. Charging will continue until the battery is fully or the device is disconnected from the power.</li>
          <li><strong>Phase 1: Power on</strong>		Power on is enabled via the power button on the device. This initializes all processes on the device and automatically starts the connecting process.</li>
          <li><strong>Phase 2: connecting</strong>		Connecting process is either triggered automatically via the power on or manually via a connect button. Connection prioritizes previously connected devices and will automatically sync with a previously paired VR headset.</li>
          <li><strong>Phase 3: Transmission of data</strong>		Data transmission occurs after a connection has been established. Transmission of data is specific to sending sensor readings to the connected VR device.</li>
          <li><strong>Phase 4: Validation of data</strong>		Once transmission of data is synchronized, validation of data is used to make sure data is reasonable. Heart rate between 30 and 225, and breathing rate between 5 and 45.</li>
          <li><strong>Phase 5: steady state use</strong>		Steady state use occurs after transmission and validation of data. Steady state use sends updates to the VR headset at the specified rate.</li>
          <li><strong>Phase 6: Low battery - reduced Data</strong>		During steady state use, low battery warning will put the device into a slower reduce data transfer rate. This option can be removed.</li>
          <li><strong>Phase 7: Critical Low battery</strong>		Critical low battery is when the electronic device only has a margin amount of power. Sending information about powering down and safely closing features before automatically going into power off mode.</li>
          <li><strong>Phase 8: Power off</strong>		Power off is a state that is either manually set or via the critical lower battery. The Power off state has the device unable to turn on. And will require aquate recharging to switch out of this state.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>End-to-End Communication Strategy:</strong>	Communication from the device to the VR headset is handled by standard bluetooth communication protocol. Capable of either transmission on 2.4 GHz ISM spectrum band (2400 to 2483.5 MHz). There is one CPU based within the electronic component that handles all preferical devices, including the communication via bluetooth receiver and transmitter.</li>
