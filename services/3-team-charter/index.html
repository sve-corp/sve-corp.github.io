<h2 id="team-roles"><strong>Team Roles:</strong></h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Team Lead:</strong> Team Lead is responsible for organizing team members into official tasks. The team lead is the point person for contact when problems or technical <em>blockers</em> arise. It is the team leads’ responsibility to organize and create flow for the team. When an issue, social or technical, arises and prevents a person from working. It is the team leads’ responsibility to organize pathways of solutions. It is not the team leads’ responsibility to come up with solutions, but may be the final decision maker.</li>
  <li><strong>Mechanical Engineer:</strong> The mechanical engineer is responsible for the physical design of the product. This includes the 3D CAD, the BOM, the consumer off the shelf purchasable items, and iterating requirements from the electrical engineering hardware list. The mechanical engineer is also responsible for sourcing purchasable items that do not fall under the category for electrical engineer. The mechanical and electrical engineer must work together to monitor design requirements. The mechanical engineer is also responsible for maintaining and setting up requirements for mechanical testing. This includes, water ingress, dust ingress (via IP rating), vibrational and drop testing.</li>
  <li><strong>Electrical Engineer:</strong> The electrical engineer is responsible for all electrical components within the device. This includes PCB, interfaces, and power requirements. The electrical engineer must integrate requirements set forth by the software engineer. And also work within requirements for the physical design with the mechanical engineer.</li>
  <li><strong>Software engineer:</strong> The software engineer is responsible for all embedded software on the device that the data scientist is not responsible for. This includes any radio frequency communication, button pushing software actions, and UI, UX design requirements. The software engineer is to work closely with the data scientist for processing data collection.</li>
  <li><strong>Financial Admin:</strong> The financial admin is responsible for identifying cost accumulation that each engineer is budgeting for. This requirement means the financial admin must be aware of what each engineer (mechanical,electrical, and software engineer are planning and require an estimated cost associated with all the requirements. This financial admin is to maintain cross disciplinary budgetary requirements.</li>
  <li><strong>Data Scientist:</strong> The data scientist is responsible for working with the software engineer to maintain data processing of all technical data collection. The data scientist is responsible for the data flow and data management.</li>
  <li><strong>Product Testing engineer:</strong> Is responsible for accumulating a list of capability from each disciple and working with that disciples engineer to create a custom set of standards that will isolate each requirement. And then build a cross disciple testing plan that will test all edge cases.</li>
  <li><strong>Project Scope Assessment person:</strong> The role of the Project Scope Assessment person is to provide discrete feedback throughout the project when different milestones are reached. The feedback is always referring to the overall goal of the project and validating that it falls within the scope of work. This is predominately important when design changes pivot in a new direction because of bottleneck constraints.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="team-rules"><strong>Team Rules</strong>:</h2>

<p><strong>Rule 1)</strong> Communicate in a respectful manner. If disagreements arise, maintain cordial communication and a willingness to listen. If no solutions are met, solutions can be had at a later time in a formal setting with a democratic voting system, and then a team lead decision.</p>

<p><strong>Rule 2)</strong> If there is an aspect of the project you’re tasked with and somebody else is interested in that aspect/part, let it be known that it is your part of the project but you are willing to share information and potentially some of the work if applicable.</p>

<p><strong>Rule 3)</strong> If you disagree with a solution and cannot find compromise via the formal methods. Attempt to understand the scope of the problem within the project, if the project can continue without <em>your version of the solution</em> then do just that.</p>

<p><strong>Rule 4)</strong> Workload is to be distributed as equally as possible, it may be true that you have a better skill set in an area and are not assigned that area. See rule number 2.</p>

<p><strong>Rule 5)</strong> Give credit and appreciation when fit.</p>

<p><strong>Rule 6)</strong>  Keep the overall goal of the project in mind. Value engineering often requires a sacrifice of certain work in favor of others, these decisions should not be personalized.</p>
