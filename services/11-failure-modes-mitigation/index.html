        <div class="content"><h2 id="some-of-the-possible-risks-that-we-may-face-are-described-below"><strong>Some of the possible risks that we may face are described below:</strong></h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Our business is heavily dependent on our IoT vendors and sensor suppliers etc. Currently, there is a huge problem of chip shortage due to increased demand in electronics. We would have to make sure that we order the required components and electronics well in advance to overcome these issues.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other scenarios could be an occurrence of natural disaster or pandemic. Currently, we are seeing one of the worst pandemics in human history in the form of COVID and people are afraid to step out of their homes. However, our project requires employees to be present in the office to develop and test the biofeedback device. This isnâ€™t a project that can be worked on remotely.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If an important resource like an employee resigns midway through the project, there is a huge chance that we will not be able to complete the project in the set timelines.
Certain resources like high performance GPUs would be required to analyze data. If we do not have such resources, we might end up spending a considerable amount of time waiting for the results.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The software may require proprietary code for the system to work. The project execution may get delayed if the company is low on money to purchase such software or if the owner of the proprietary software is taking time to share their code.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="mitigation-strategies-for-the-above-problems"><strong>Mitigation Strategies for the above problems:</strong></h2>

<ol>
  <li>We would have to pre-order all the required electronics to avoid issues related to chip shortage. Also, a plan must be developed to run on simulators in case the hardware is not available to keep the project moving forward.</li>
  <li>Employees must be given assurance about the safety and precautions being taken by the management to encourage them to visit the office.</li>
  <li>All the employees within the team must have basic knowledge about all the subsytems within the biofeedback device. When the employee resigns, knowledge transfer should take place.</li>
  <li>The company budget should account for buying high performance GPUs.</li>
  <li>We must develop an alternative strategy where we use opensource code instead of proprietary software.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="team-issues"><strong>Team Issues</strong></h2>
<p>Teram issue that can occur and ways to mitigate them.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Lack of participation</strong>: Sometimes there is a chance that some of the project members will not show enthusiasm in working on the project. In such a scenario the burden will fall on few other team members slowing down the execution. In such a scenario, we would have to approach the higher ups to mitigate such kinds of issues.</li>
  <li><strong>Lack of creativity:</strong> If the team is unable to develop fresh ideas, there is a high chance to develop lethargy and lose enthusiasm in the project. The project lead must take an initiative to read upon the current research areas and topics of interest and encourage all the team members to read and implement those concepts in the system.</li>
  <li><strong>Poor Communication</strong>: Team members may interrupt or talk over when someone else is making their point. These kinds of problems often lead to arguments and disagreements within the team members in case one feels that their opinions are not being heard. The leader must make sure that all the project members are treated equally and gather required information. Anonymous surveys must be held by the top management every few months where they get an idea about the group members and their feelings about the other team members.</li>
  <li><strong>Ineffective leadership:</strong> Oftentimes, the leader takes upon most of the tasks and ends up being overburdened. Rather, the team lead must ensure to delegate the tasks to other team members as well. Also, if a compelling vision is not defined, the team will lack focus.</li>
