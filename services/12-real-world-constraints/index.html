<h2 id="environmental-effects">Environmental Effects</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>E-Waste</strong>: Like any electronic product, our product will also lead to e-waste once it is out of order and beyond repair. The problem with e-waste is that most electronics contain toxic materials like lead, zinc, barium, and chromium. Once these electronics are dumped as waste, these toxic materials mix with the soil and underground water, which can cause serious health issues if someone ingests or come in contact with these materials. Furthermore, when such kind of e-waste gets warmed up due to sun or other factors, toxic chemicals get released from the e-waste, damaging the atmosphere.</p>

    <p><strong>Solution</strong>: To mitigate the e-waste problem, we systems engineers need to make sure that more greener parts are used in the production of the product. Even though toxic components might be cheaper and readily available, we need to make wiser decisions on things that can impact the whole planet. For example, while recycling wires and cables, the plastic insulation that we see on cables are burned off to get to the more valuable copper in the middle, releasing various harmful and toxic chemicals into the atmosphere. A wiser decision here will be to use wires that have Norly coating in production, which are greener than conventional PVCs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Carbon Emission</strong>: Another detrimental effect that our project can have on the environment is the amount of carbon emission released into the atmosphere during the entire production process, from powering the production line to fuelling the shipping vessels to transport the products to store. These emissions, when added, can be colossal if not appropriately monitored.</p>

    <p><strong>Solution</strong>: As majority of electronics are made in countries with drastically differing carbon emissions and labor restrictions than the United States. We need to make sure that the production of our product happens in a country that respects the Paris Agreement and has strict carbon laws in place.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="ethical-effects">Ethical Effects</h2>

<ol>
  <li>We have to be careful when making promises of accurate diagnostic, purely based on sensor values and data, no matter how accurate our backend ML model is. At the end of the day, it is just an algorithm making predictions based on the sensor values. For starters, it is impossible to have an ML model which can give 100% accuracy on unseen data. Furthermore, since the model will rely on sensor reading if the sensor is malfunctioning, the ML model will also malfunction. Therefore, we have to consider this factor while making any claims on the diagnostic capabilities of our product.</li>
  <li>The project’s impact on the environment can be profound, from using energy to power factories to fuelling the cargo ships transporting the final product, with diesel. Even if the product can hugely impact the society, it may fail if it its production has a considerable carbon footprint. If we look at the example of Bitcoin, even if it is a great alternative to gold, mining Bitcoin consumes much power, so much so that its carbon footprint is enormous compared to mining gold. So even if Bitcoin is tech-wise a superior alternative to traditional money, its acceptance is still low because of this one pressing issue. Minimizing the overall carbon footprint of the product should be considered for making the product a success.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="safety-concerns">Safety Concerns</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Electric Shocks</strong>: Excessive leakage current can come from ageing or malfunctioning circuitry, poses a risk of electrical shocks. The risk can be even high when the device is connected to the electrical mains for charging.</p>

    <p>We can take several design decisions to minimize the risk of electric shocks during the usage of our product. First, we should make sure that the PCB is well enclosed and adequately insulated. Then we need to ensure that the inputs and the outputs are well isolated from other circuitry. We should also have a robust protection circuitry to lower the risk of electric shocks in the event of high current passing through the circuit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Chemical Reactions</strong>: Certain metals and synthetic fabrics can cause rashes and other allergic responses when coming in contact with the skin. When designing a wearable device like our product, we should ensure that such materials are avoided or not present on any surface of the product that can contact the user’s skin.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Burns</strong>: When the wearable device is used for a prolonged period, it may heat up, since such smart devices carry powerful processors and other computing components that can heat up due to high switching speeds. Exposure to such a high temperature for an extended period can cause damage to the human tissue. 
To mitigate this when designing the hardware, we would have to make sure that heat sinks are installed to dissipate heat from PCB components into a cooling medium.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="ways-to-avoid-above-concerns">Ways to avoid above concerns</h2>

<p>Yes, the above-listed concerns can be avoided if, before starting with the design, we can list down all the potential concerns and effects of the product. After listing them down, we can sit with the concerned team and have a good deliberation on each item on the list. During this session, all the concerns should be examined thoroughly, and a way to address these concerns should be documented so that they can be used during the design process. Only after completing this stage, the project should move to the design phase.</p>

<h2 id="users-concerns">Users’ Concerns</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Data Privacy</strong>: Data privacy is a growing concern for users in today’s data-driven world. Businesses can send out targeted advertising, predict sales trends, and improve their products through data. However, consumers see it differently. For them, data collection is an invasion of their privacy and a practice that big corporations can easily abuse.</li>
  <li><strong>Reliability</strong>: For a user, reliability can be defined as whether the product will do what it is supposed to do overtime. It should solve the intended problem without creating new ones. For our product, for instance, the user would love that the heart rate and breathing rate measured by the device are utterly accurate and the predictions and suggestions made on these too. Even if the product outshines in all other aspects but is not reliable, the user will soon outgrow that and move to a different product that may not be as shiny as our product but is more reliable.</li>
