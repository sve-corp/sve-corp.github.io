<h2 id="hardware-subsystems-oximetry-sensor-battery-rf-transmitterreceiver-leds-buttons">Hardware Subsystems: Oximetry Sensor, Battery, RF Transmitter/Receiver, LEDs, Buttons</h2>

<h3 id="oximetry-sensor-sensor-system-that-measures-o2-levels"><strong>Oximetry Sensor:</strong> Sensor system that measures O2 levels.</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Inputs:</strong> The raw data input will be the laser reflectance from a Laser emitting diode.  The receiver device has onboard electronics from the manufacturer to read this information and quantify the information into human readable levels.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Outputs:</strong> The output of this device will be the O2 levels that are calculated from the onboard sensor electronics.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Interfaces:</strong> The interface between the oximetry sensor and the main board is via I2C communication protocol and wiring.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Subsystem Behaviors:</strong> This system when supplied power is constantly sending information. Whether the information is read or not is dependent on the machine that is listening.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Software to Manage Oximetry Sensor Hardware:</strong> The sensor continuously outputs information via the I2C communication line. The CPU will collect this information and store it in a local buffer. This local buffer then gets pulled upon by the Information_pull_request. If Information_pull_request is not enacted the buffer will drop/clean this memory space after 10 seconds.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Requirements</strong>: The IC shall receive current in the range of 0 to 20 mA. The operating voltage shall be in between 2.3 V and 3.3 V.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="battery-main-subsystem-responsible-for-allowing-power-for-operating-the-device"><strong>Battery:</strong> Main subsystem responsible for allowing power for operating the device.</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Inputs:</strong> Power input from an AC/DC wall jack via barrel plug is the main input.</li>
  <li><strong>Outputs:</strong> Output is electricity flow throughout the device.</li>
  <li><strong>Interfaces:</strong> Power in and power out are throughout the main PCB board. There are diodes/capacitors in parallel with these components, as well as specialty power ICs for monitoring power draw and supply max/limitations.</li>
  <li><strong>Subsystem Behaviors:</strong> System passive with passive protective circuitry. If the device is being charged and used at the same time, the battery system is bypassed via voltage difference behaviors via ICs.</li>
  <li><strong>Software to Manage Battery Hardware:</strong> Charging and discharging the battery is all done by passive components. The main software is used to monitor the battery lifespace and to read voltage levels to display battery life left.</li>
  <li><strong>Requirements:</strong>The device shall contain a lithium polymer battery of 85mAh capacity. The battery should last for at least 3 years.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="rf-transmitterreceiver-device-used-for-radio-frequency-transmission-and-receiving"><strong>RF Transmitter/Receiver:</strong> Device used for radio frequency transmission and receiving.</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Inputs:</strong> Input can come from the onboard CPU via the onboard bluetooth protocol, or from the transmitter side via radio wave information that only transmits if adherent to the bluetooth protocol.</li>
  <li><strong>Outputs:</strong>Outputs can be transmitted out to a receiving device via bluetooth, or by collecting transmission radio wave information and sending it to the onboard CPU.</li>
  <li><strong>Interfaces:</strong> I2C connection from the RF transmitter/receiver to onboard CPU, and antenna collecting broadcasted radio waves (in bluetooth standard 2.4 GHz frequency.)</li>
  <li><strong>Subsystem Behaviors:</strong> The system is a passive system that collects and transmits data it receives at specified intervals. If the system has power it will continue to do so with no acknowledgement of ‘important behavior.’ It is up to the connected CPU to build protocols for acknowledgement of information.</li>
  <li><strong>Software to Manage RF Transmitter/Receiver Hardware:</strong> The CPU needs to go into a search mode in order to establish connection to a remote VR device. The CPU is also responsible for sending sensor data. The RF transmitter/receiver is simply the mode in which these communication processes can take place. There is no specific software to run the RF system, but there is software for organizing the information that is sent/received.</li>
  <li><strong>Requirements:</strong> To be able to transmit data at at least 100 KB/s with a focus to 160 KB/s.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="leds"><strong>LEDS:</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Inputs:</strong>  under 20 mA current from PCB board, logic supplied by the CPU onboard.</li>
  <li><strong>Outputs:</strong> Visible light spectrum.</li>
  <li><strong>Interfaces:</strong> Cathode/anode 2 prong device that is used to transmit power.</li>
  <li><strong>Subsystem Behaviors:</strong> Used for visual indication of various information for the user.</li>
  <li><strong>Software to Manage LED Hardware:</strong> LEDs are passive hardware devices that do not require software for their interaction. The “software only” subsystem will utilize the LEDs for their ability.</li>
  <li><strong>Requirements:</strong> Low power consumption at maximum 20 mA with a 15 Lumens/watt value.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="buttons"><strong>Buttons:</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Inputs:</strong> Physical depression of button.</li>
  <li><strong>Outputs:</strong>  Depression will short a circuit that is used to indicate actionable items.</li>
  <li><strong>Interfaces:</strong> Surface mount hardware, 2 prong devices.</li>
  <li><strong>Subsystem Behaviors:</strong> Two different actionable items based on longevity of depression. A short depression, meaning under 3 seconds is action item 1, while a longer depression is actionable item 2.</li>
  <li><strong>Software to Manage button Hardware:</strong> Buttons are passive hardware devices that do not require software for their interaction. The “software only” subsystem will utilize the buttons for their ability and information.</li>
  <li><strong>Requirements:</strong> Ability to be click-cycled 10,000 times in accordance with the testing standards described in the testing procedure section.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="software-only-subsystems"><strong>Software Only Subsystems</strong>:</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Power information:</strong> Power information is a voltage difference measurement between the battery terminals. This voltage difference is compared against a digital chart to find it’s percentage left. This power level is then used as information that is sent to the VR headset. This information is periodically updated once every minute.</li>
  <li><strong>Requirements:</strong> Maintain a battery accuracy of 2 percent.</li>
  <li><strong>Connecting a Device:</strong> Connecting to a device is a button navacable depression for longer than 3 seconds. This button depression tells the CPU to start receiving Bluetooth connection information at the same time sending out bluetooth connection information. This will happen for 1 minute before turning off and indicating with a flashing red LED that no connection was formed.</li>
  <li><strong>Requirements:</strong> To be able to clear errors and missing information when partial transmission occurs. To favor resetting information when too much information is lost via transmission.</li>
  <li><strong>Data Transmission:</strong> Once connecting to a device is indicated as complete. Data transmission occurs via the bluetooth RF connection. This is sensor data information sent at 10 times a second. This will also occur after 3 seconds of data being ‘relatively stable’ at +/- 3 percent. If this device is not stable then an indicator will be sent to the VR for unstable device location.</li>
  <li><strong>Requirements:</strong> To be able to maintain a buffer when actively sending information of the last 5 minutes. To be able to validate when information is not being sent via a lost connection and provide indication.</li>
